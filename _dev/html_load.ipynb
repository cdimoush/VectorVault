Isaac Sim uses to build its applications, provides a Python interpreter for scripting. This means every single GUI command, as well as many additional functions are available as Python APIs. However, the learning curve for interfacing with Omniverse Kit using Pixar’s USD Python API is steep and steps are frequently tedious. Therefore we’ve provided a set of APIs that are designed to be used in robotics applications, APIs that abstract away the complexity of USD APIs and merge multiple steps into one for frequently performed tasks.\\nIn this tutorial, we will present the concepts of Core APIs and how to use them. We will start with adding a cube to an empty stage, and we’ll build upon it to create a scene with multiple robots executing mulitple tasks simultaneously, as seen below.\\n\\n\\n\\nLearning Objectives#\\nThis tutorial series introduces the Core API. After this tutorial, you learn:\\n\\nCreating a World and Scene as defined by the Core API.\\nHow to add a rigid body to the Stage and simulate it using python in Omniverse Isaac Sim.\\nThe difference between running python in an Extension Workflow vs a Standalone Workflow, and in Jupyter Notebook.\\n\\n10-15 Minute Tutorial\\n\\n\\nGetting Started#\\nPrerequisites\\n\\nIntermediate knowledge in Python and asynchronous programming is required for this tutorial.\\nPlease download and install Visual Studio Code prior to beginning this tutorial.\\nPlease review Isaac Sim Interface and Isaac Sim Workflows prior to beginning this tutorial.\\n\\nBegin by opening the Hello World example.\\n\\nGo to the top menu bar and click Isaac Examples > Hello World.\\nVerify that the window for the Hello World example extension is visible in the workspace.\\nClick the Open Source Code button to launch the source code for editing in Visual Studio Code.\\n\\n\\n\\n4. Click the Open Containing Folder button to open the directory containing the example files.\\nThis folder contains three files: hello_world.py, hello_world_extension.py, and __init__.py.\\nThe hello_world.py script is where the logic of the application will be added, while the UI\\nelements of the application will be added in hello_world_extension.py script and thus\\nlinked to the logic.\\n\\nClick the LOAD button to load the World.\\nclick File > New From Stage Template > Empty to create a new stage, click Don’t Save when prompted to save the current stage.\\nClick the LOAD button to load the World again.\\nOpen hello_world.py and press “Ctrl+S” to use the hot-reload feature. You will\\nnotice that the menu disappears from the workspace (because it was restarted).\\nOpen the example menu again and click the LOAD button.\\n\\nNow you can begin adding to this example.\\n\\n\\nCode Overview#\\nThis example inherits from BaseSample, which is a boilerplate extension application that\\nsets up the basics for every robotics extension application. The following are a few examples of the\\nactions BaseSample performs:\\n\\nLoading the world with its corresponding assets using a button.\\nClearing the world when a new stage is created.\\nResetting the world’s objects to their default states.\\nHandling hot reloading.\\n\\nWorld is the core class that enables you to interact with the simulator\\nin an easy and modular way. It handles many time-related events such as adding callbacks,\\nstepping physics,  resetting the scene, adding tasks (this will be covered later in\\nAdding a Manipulator Robot), etc.\\nA world contains an instance of a Scene. The Scene class manages\\nsimulation assets of interest in the USD Stage. It provides an easy\\nAPI to add, manipulate, inspect, and reset different USD assets in the stage.\\n 1from omni.isaac.examples.base_sample import BaseSample #boiler plate of a robotics extension application\\n 2\\n 3class HelloWorld(BaseSample):\\n 4    def __init__(self) -> None:\\n 5        super().__init__()\\n 6        return\\n 7\\n 8    # This function is called to setup the assets in the scene for the first time\\n 9    # Class variables should not be assigned here, since this function is not called\\n10    # after a hot-reload, its only called to load the world starting from an EMPTY stage\\n11    def setup_scene(self):\\n12        # A world is defined in the BaseSample, can be accessed everywhere EXCEPT __init__\\n13        world = self.get_world()\\n14        world.scene.add_default_ground_plane() # adds a default ground plane to the scene\\n15        return\\n\\n\\n\\nSingleton World#\\nWorld is a Singleton, which means only one World can exist while running\\nOmniverse Isaac Sim.

This means every single GUI command, as well as many additional functions are available as Python APIs. However, the learning curve for interfacing with Omniverse Kit using Pixar’s USD Python API is steep and steps are frequently tedious. Therefore we’ve provided a set of APIs that are designed to be used in robotics applications, APIs that abstract away the complexity of USD APIs and merge multiple steps into one for frequently performed tasks.\\nIn this tutorial, we will present the concepts of Core APIs and how to use them. We will start with adding a cube to an empty stage, and we’ll build upon it to create a scene with multiple robots executing mulitple tasks simultaneously, as seen below.\\n\\n\\n\\nLearning Objectives#\\nThis tutorial series introduces the Core API. After this tutorial, you learn:\\n\\nCreating a World and Scene as defined by the Core API.\\nHow to add a rigid body to the Stage and simulate it using python in Omniverse Isaac Sim.\\nThe difference between running python in an Extension Workflow vs a Standalone Workflow, and in Jupyter Notebook.\\n\\n10-15 Minute Tutorial\\n\\n\\nGetting Started#\\nPrerequisites\\n\\nIntermediate knowledge in Python and asynchronous programming is required for this tutorial.\\nPlease download and install Visual Studio Code prior to beginning this tutorial.\\nPlease review Isaac Sim Interface and Isaac Sim Workflows prior to beginning this tutorial.\\n\\nBegin by opening the Hello World example.\\n\\nGo to the top menu bar and click Isaac Examples > Hello World.\\nVerify that the window for the Hello World example extension is visible in the workspace.\\nClick the Open Source Code button to launch the source code for editing in Visual Studio Code.\\n\\n\\n\\n4. Click the Open Containing Folder button to open the directory containing the example files.\\nThis folder contains three files: hello_world.py, hello_world_extension.py, and __init__.py.\\nThe hello_world.py script is where the logic of the application will be added, while the UI\\nelements of the application will be added in hello_world_extension.py script and thus\\nlinked to the logic.\\n\\nClick the LOAD button to load the World.\\nclick File > New From Stage Template > Empty to create a new stage, click Don’t Save when prompted to save the current stage.\\nClick the LOAD button to load the World again.\\nOpen hello_world.py and press “Ctrl+S” to use the hot-reload feature. You will\\nnotice that the menu disappears from the workspace (because it was restarted).\\nOpen the example menu again and click the LOAD button.\\n\\nNow you can begin adding to this example.\\n\\n\\nCode Overview#\\nThis example inherits from BaseSample, which is a boilerplate extension application that\\nsets up the basics for every robotics extension application. The following are a few examples of the\\nactions BaseSample performs:\\n\\nLoading the world with its corresponding assets using a button.\\nClearing the world when a new stage is created.\\nResetting the world’s objects to their default states.\\nHandling hot reloading.\\n\\nWorld is the core class that enables you to interact with the simulator\\nin an easy and modular way. It handles many time-related events such as adding callbacks,\\nstepping physics,  resetting the scene, adding tasks (this will be covered later in\\nAdding a Manipulator Robot), etc.\\nA world contains an instance of a Scene. The Scene class manages\\nsimulation assets of interest in the USD Stage. It provides an easy\\nAPI to add, manipulate, inspect, and reset different USD assets in the stage.\\n 1from omni.isaac.examples.base_sample import BaseSample #boiler plate of a robotics extension application\\n 2\\n 3class HelloWorld(BaseSample):\\n 4    def __init__(self) -> None:\\n 5        super().__init__()\\n 6        return\\n 7\\n 8    # This function is called to setup the assets in the scene for the first time\\n 9    # Class variables should not be assigned here, since this function is not called\\n10    # after a hot-reload, its only called to load the world starting from an EMPTY stage\\n11    def setup_scene(self):\\n12        # A world is defined in the BaseSample, can be accessed everywhere EXCEPT __init__\\n13        world = self.get_world()\\n14        world.scene.add_default_ground_plane() # adds a default ground plane to the scene\\n15        return\\n\\n\\n\\nSingleton World#\\nWorld is a Singleton, which means only one World can exist while running\\nOmniverse Isaac Sim.

This means every single GUI command, as well as many additional functions are available as Python APIs. However, the learning curve for interfacing with Omniverse Kit using Pixar’s USD Python API is steep and steps are frequently tedious. Therefore we’ve provided a set of APIs that are designed to be used in robotics applications, APIs that abstract away the complexity of USD APIs and merge multiple steps into one for frequently performed tasks.\n",

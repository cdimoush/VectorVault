# Notes

Hey just add a power session to get tiered html files to work. Shorta works Just a couple of things.

1) Encoding Error

2025-01-20 14:35:34,043 - ERROR - Error loading file _local_vault\unprocessed\features\warehouse_logistics\tutorial_static_assets.html: 'charmap' codec can't decode byte 0x9d in position 67723: character maps to <undefined>
2025-01-20 14:35:34,043 - WARNING - Skipping file tutorial_static_assets.html


How to make sure that an encoding error doesn't prevent the file from being processed.

2) HTML Trash 

noticing that I am getting lots of content that is identical and probably sidebars or footer on websites.
